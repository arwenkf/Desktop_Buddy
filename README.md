# Desktop Buddy (WIP)


# Summary
* Desktop Buddy using 3D models to encourage focus and healthy study habits
* Planned to write in C# and make models in Blender
* Focus on providing a light-hearted way to find fun in work and study

# Objectives
* User interaction
* Use of timers, modelling, rigging
* Nice look and clean code

# How To Run
* Code not yet available (coming soon!)

# Development Status
First release goal: one animal model done with basic functions by the end of January. This means deciding on the functions of the project that fall in line with my goals as well as creating models that function and look good. I hope to implement my code nicely.

Current Status:
* Model one created and rigged! Working on animation and placing it into an interactive space.
